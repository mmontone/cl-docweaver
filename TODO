* Consider using `(type)name` syntax in docstrings for referencing parts of the manual. For example, `(node)My node` to reference Texinfo node "My node" from docstrings.
* Implement a test document that tests the output of every weaving command.
* Control docstring parsing from config.
Options to:
- Parse urls
- Force explicit elisp type references `(type)name`; normal words are not parsed as function/variable references in that case.
